# 🎓 Hackerrank:Python Program to Find Students with the Second Lowest Grade

🎯 Aim
To write a Python program to find the simple intrest.

🧠 Algorithm
1. Start
2. Input the Principal amount P from the user.
3. Input the Rate of interest R (per annum) from the user.
4. Input the Time T in months from the user.
5. Convert Time into years: Tyear=T/12
6. Apply the formula for Simple Interest: SI=PRTyear/100
7. Display the value of SI.
8. Stop
   
💻 Program
```python
p=int(input())

t=float(input())

r=eval(input())

def simpleInterest(p,t,r):

si = (p*t*r)/100

return si
```
Output
